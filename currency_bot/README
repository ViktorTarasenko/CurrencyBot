You can run this app as module with -m option: python3 -m currency_bot
You will need to install required libraries(you will see if they missed while running script) and provide your own token in file bot.py, you can obtain it by creating your bot in telegram
This bot works in polling mod, because webhook is more complex to implement and requires server in the area where telegram is not blocked(polling is not nice for prod but this is tesk task)
However to run this app you will probably need vpn connection if telegram is blocked in your country
